# Cyber Security Base Project

This is my project for the Cyber Security Base course at the University of Helsinki.

It is a web application with different security flaws. I point out the flaws in the essay below and refer to comments in the code.

## Running the Project

To run the project, you need Django and Python installed. If you use a virtual environment, you can install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/arvidkullhammar/cyber-security-base-projectI.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change directory into the project directory.

   ```sh
   cd cyber-security-base-projectI
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: If you're using a virtual environment, activate it and install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.

   ```sh
   # Activate virtual environment (optional)
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   myenv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Server**: Start the Django development server.

   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

5. **Access the Application**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Security Flaws

I have identified several security flaws in the application. These flaws are documented in the essay below and referenced in the code comments.
